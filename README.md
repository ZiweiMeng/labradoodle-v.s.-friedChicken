+ Project summary: In this project, we created a classification engine for images of poodles versus images of fried chicken in black and white thus focusing on texture instead of color. We added CNN features extracted from pre-trained Inception V3 network which decrease our test error by a lot. At the same time, we tested several classifiers on our data: GBM, SVM, Random Forest and Logistic Regression. Among these models, Logistic Regression and SVM yielded the most accurate results. We ensembled them to get the final model, reached a 95.5% accuracy compared to 72.4% accuracy of baseline model.

**Contribution statement**:<br/>
+ Ziwei tuned the baseline model, was responsible for the extraction of the CNN features, formatted the main code according to the guidelines and organized the presentation.<br/>
+ Jingru tuned advanced model with logistic regression on both SIFT and CNN features, selected best lambda using grid search and cross-validation.<br/>
+ Nanjun tuned advanced model with SVM using linear kernel on both SIFT and CNN features, selected best cost using grid search and cross-validation.<br/>
+ Chengcheng tuned advanced model with random forest on both SIFT and CNN features, selected best n.var using grid search and cross-validation.<br/>
+ Bowen tuned advanced model with GBM on both SIFT and CNN features, selected best n.trees using grid search and cross-validation.<br/>
